# GitHub Project Templates and Kanban Board Implementation

## 1️⃣ Template Analysis and Selection

### Comparison of GitHub Project Templates

| **Template** | **Columns & Workflow** | **Automation Features** | **Suitability for Agile** |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Basic Kanban** | To Do, In Progress, Done | Manual updates only | Suitable for simple task tracking, but lacks automation for Agile workflows. |
| **Automated Kanban** | Backlog, To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done | Auto-moves issues when PRs are merged, closes completed issues | Ideal for Agile development, as it streamlines workflow and reduces manual updates. |
| **Bug Triage** | New, Under Investigation, In Progress, Fixed, Closed | Auto-labels issues as they are moved | Best for issue tracking and bug resolution but not comprehensive for full Agile development. |

### Justification for Template Choice
We chose **Automated Kanban** because:
- It supports **sprint tracking** with built-in automation.
- It reduces manual updates by **auto-moving issues** based on pull request activity.
- It aligns with Agile workflows by maintaining a **clear backlog and workflow visualization**.
