##  What is a Kanban Board?

A **Kanban board** is a visual project management tool that:
1. Uses columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) to represent workflow stages.
2. Limits work-in-progress (WIP) to prevent overload.
3. Provides real-time visibility into task statuses.
4. Enhances collaboration by clarifying responsibilities.

### How Our Kanban Board Supports Agile Workflows:
1. **Workflow Visualization:**
   - Columns represent **task progress** (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Testing`, `Blocked`, `Done`).
   - Helps the team **see bottlenecks** and optimize flow.
2. **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits:**
   - WIP is limited to **3 tasks per column** to prevent overload and ensure focus.
3. **Agile Principles:**
   - Encourages **continuous delivery** by keeping work flowing.
   - Enhances **adaptability** by allowing backlog adjustments based on priorities.

### Key Features

1. **Real-time Task Tracking**
   - Tasks automatically move between columns based on issue updates.
   - Ensures visibility and accountability across the team.

2. **Customizable Workflows**
   - Added ‘Testing’ and ‘Blocked’ columns to improve quality assurance and dependency management.
   - Supports Agile methodology with iterative improvements.

3. **Seamless Integration with GitHub Issues**
   - Links tasks directly to GitHub Issues for easy reference and collaboration.
   - Labels categorize tasks efficiently (`feature`, `bug`, `enhancement`).

4. **Enhanced Collaboration**
   - Team members can comment, mention others, and track issue updates in real time.
   - Ensures that work is distributed effectively with clear ownership.
