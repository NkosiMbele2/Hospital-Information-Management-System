##  Reflection

### Challenges Faced:
- Selecting the right template required **understanding automation trade-offs**.
- Customizing the board took time to align with **our sprint workflow**.
- Ensuring team members **actively update the board**.

### Comparison with Other Tools:
| **Tool** | **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **GitHub Projects** | Integrated with GitHub Issues & PRs, automated workflows | Limited custom reporting |
| **Trello** | Highly customizable, easy to use | No built-in developer automation |
| **Jira** | Advanced Agile features, customizable workflows | Complex setup, steep learning curve |

ðŸ“Œ *Overall, GitHub Projects was the best choice due to its direct integration with our repository and automated Agile workflow management.*
