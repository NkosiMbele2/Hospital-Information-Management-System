## üöÄ Non-Functional Test Scenarios  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Test**  
**Requirement ID:** NFR-011 (Search results must be displayed within 2 seconds)  
**Test Scenario:**  
- Simulate **1,000 concurrent users** performing searches in the system.  
- Measure response time for search queries.  
**Expected Result:** Search results should be displayed **‚â§ 2 seconds** under peak load.
