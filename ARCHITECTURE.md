The C4 model, as you know, has four levels of abstraction: Context, Containers, Components, and Code. I'll break this down and structure it as requested.

Project Title: Hospital Information Management System (HIMS)

1. Domain: Healthcare (Hospital)
The HIMS is a software system designed for a hospital setting. The system integrates all hospital operations, including patient registration, scheduling,
medical records management, billing, and reporting. It replaces traditional paper-based record-keeping with digital processes, ensuring data is secure, accessible,
and up-to-date in real-time. The system is meant to optimize hospital management, improve patient care, and ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.

Full Description of the Domain:
- Healthcare is a broad field that involves various services aimed at maintaining and improving physical and mental health. In a hospital context,
  it includes managing patient care, staff operations, financial records, and regulatory compliance.
- The HIMS will enable seamless communication and data exchange among different departments of the hospital (e.g., clinical, administrative, billing, and pharmacy).
- It will enable easy tracking of patient histories, appointment scheduling, diagnostic results, and billing processes, with secure data handling in accordance with relevant standards.

  2. Problem Statement:
The Hospital Information Management System (HIMS) aims to replace traditional paper-based records with a comprehensive digital system. Hospitals currently face challenges like:

- Inefficiencies: Paper records are cumbersome, slow to retrieve, and prone to human error.
- Data Breaches: Physical records are vulnerable to loss, theft, or unauthorized access.
- Disjointed Systems: Information is often scattered across different departments, making it difficult to share and use effectively.
- Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations and maintaining up-to-date records can be complicated with paper-based systems.

  System’s Purpose:
- The HIMS centralizes all hospital data into one secure, real-time digital platform.
- It provides a seamless, user-friendly interface for patients, medical staff, and administrators.
- It offers robust data security features to ensure compliance with health data protection regulations.
- It ensures efficient appointment scheduling, billing, and access to medical records, ultimately improving patient care, administrative efficiency, and hospital management.

3. Individual Scope: Feasibility Justification
Scope of the Project:
- The HIMS will handle core hospital operations such as patient registration, medical records management, appointment scheduling, and billing.
- It will integrate with external systems such as insurance providers and pharmacies.
- The system will include a web application for patients, a mobile app for medical staff, and a backend API for business logic and data management.

  Feasibility Justification:
- Technological Feasibility: The hospital already has modern computing infrastructure, and the system can be built using existing technologies like REST APIs,
  relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), and modern frontend frameworks (React, Angular).
- Operational Feasibility: The hospital staff is already familiar with digital tools, and training will be provided to transition smoothly from paper-based processes.
- Financial Feasibility: While initial costs include system development and deployment, long-term benefits such as reduced paper costs,
  improved data accuracy, and operational efficiency will provide a strong return on investment.
- Regulatory Feasibility: The system will be developed with robust security measures to comply with healthcare regulations.

C4 Architecture Diagram:

Level 1: Context Diagram (System Context)
Purpose: The Context Diagram shows the system's boundaries and how it interacts with external entities.

- HIMS (Hospital Information Management System): The central system that handles all hospital operations.
- External Entities:
    Patients: Interact with the system to schedule appointments, view medical records, and make payments.
    Doctors and Medical Staff: Use the system to access patient data, update records, make diagnoses, and manage treatment plans.
    Administrators: Manage users, system configurations, and generate reports.
    External Systems: Insurance Providers (for claims), Pharmacies (for prescriptions), and Regulatory Bodies (for compliance).

Level 2: Container Diagram
Purpose: The Container Diagram breaks the system into major containers (applications or services) that work together to fulfill the system’s functionality.

Containers:
- Web Application (Frontend): Used by patients, doctors, and administrators to interact with the system.
- Mobile Application (for Medical Staff): Mobile access for doctors and nurses to view records and make updates.
- Backend API: Provides business logic and data access. Handles authentication, authorization, and interactions with the database.
- Database: Centralized relational database that stores patient data, appointments, billing information, etc.
- External Systems: Insurance and pharmacy integrations.
