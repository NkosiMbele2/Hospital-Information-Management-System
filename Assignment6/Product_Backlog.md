### Justification for Prioritization
- **Must-have** stories are critical for core functionality and align with stakeholder success metrics (e.g., usability, security, compliance). These features ensure the system is usable and secure from the beginning.
- **Should-have** stories enhance efficiency and hospital operations but are not immediately required for system functionality.
- **Could-have** stories provide additional benefits but can be implemented later without disrupting core operations.
- **Wonâ€™t-have** features (not listed) are intentionally deprioritized for this release cycle.

ðŸ“Œ *This backlog will be continuously refined based on stakeholder feedback and development progress.*
