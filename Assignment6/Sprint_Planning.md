## Sprint Goal Statement
This sprint is essential for establishing the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** by ensuring core patient and doctor functionalities are fully implemented. By the end of the sprint, users should be able to register, book appointments, and medical staff should be able to manage patient records efficiently. This lays the groundwork for further enhancements, such as billing and reporting in future sprints.
