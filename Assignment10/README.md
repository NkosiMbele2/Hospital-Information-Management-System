## ðŸ§ª Class Implementation

The `/src` folder contains the Python class implementations based on our class diagram. We chose **JAVA** for its simplicity and readability, which aligns well with rapid prototyping in Agile workflows.

### ðŸ”§ Design Decisions
- Used private attributes and added getters/setters to enforce encapsulation.
- Avoided inheritance for `Doctor` and `Patient` to keep responsibilities distinct.
- Modeled composition (e.g., Invoice â†’ Payment) through method-level associations.
- Methods mirror those in the UML class diagram and support core user stories.
