### üîç Challenges in Choosing Granularity
One of the key challenges was **deciding the level of detail** to include in both state and activity diagrams. Too much detail risked overwhelming the reader and making diagrams unreadable, while too little might have missed critical transitions or steps.

- **State Diagrams**: We had to strike a balance between including every possible object state (e.g., "Reserved", "Overdue", "Lost") and maintaining a clear behavioral model.
- **Activity Diagrams**: The workflows could easily become cluttered with too many actions. We grouped smaller steps under higher-level actions (e.g., ‚ÄúValidate Form‚Äù instead of listing each field check) for clarity.

### üîÑ Aligning Diagrams with Agile User Stories
Aligning diagrams to Agile user stories required careful mapping:
- **User stories often focus on outcomes**, while diagrams show system behavior or task flows.
- We used **acceptance criteria** and sprint tasks as bridges to ensure each diagram reflected actual user requirements and developer responsibilities.

For example:
- User Story: *"As a student, I want to borrow a book..."* was traced to both:
  - An **activity diagram** for "Book Checkout".
  - A **state diagram** for "Book" showing transitions like "Available" ‚Üí "Checked Out".

### ‚öñÔ∏è Comparing State vs Activity Diagrams
| Aspect               | State Diagrams                                | Activity Diagrams                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Focus                | Object lifecycle / internal behavior          | Business process / task sequences             |
| Good for             | Tracking system status over time              | Mapping out complex workflows                 |
| Viewpoint            | Event-driven changes in state                 | Flow of control with decisions & concurrency  |
| Example              | Book ‚Üí Reserved ‚Üí Checked Out ‚Üí Returned      | Borrow book ‚Üí Check availability ‚Üí Confirm    |
